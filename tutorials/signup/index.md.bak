Sign up for ACENji is a very stright process. Only  one person from an entity needs to sign up and then they can add additional users internally who will have their onboarding process but that is different from the initial signup

For a start you can do it on mobile or Web broser by going on  <a href="https://acenji.com" target="_blank">ACENji NoCode Platform </a> 

There are two ways to start the sign up process

1. Sign up directly by clicking on the **Cards** button
