# Rich Editor Element

Ritch Editor elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. There is small difference when used in Forms vs Cards. In Cards, one card - one rich text editor, where in Forms, one Form, many rich text editors, but each one has to be on a separate page. The idea is to provide the user with the ability to use rich text editor that give them experience of a writing environment.
