# Question: I have the list in CSV - under 10,000 voters.
Hi- I am interested in generating a walk list for a group of just under 10,000 registered voters. I have the list in CSV form from our Virginia State Board of Elections (we are a qualified & registered referendum committee for the November 7 elections. How can we generate and use the lists?

# Answer : 
Hi, Your format is perfect for our system. You need to signup with us and then follow this tutorial of how to create a campaign. After you created the campaign using that file, you can create unlimited number of walklists by slicing and dicing the original file with many filters you want to apply to the data. Each walklist is then ready to be pushed for canvassing.
