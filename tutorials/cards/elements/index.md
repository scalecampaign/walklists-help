# Cards Elements

What are **Cards Elements**?

<p>To begin we probably need to describe what are forms first. Forms had been around for a long time either as part of the server-side/OS or by using Hypertext Markup Language on the client-side and then sending it to the server. In ACENji, as part of the no-code language, we use forms for some type of populating descriptive flow with eventually an action or several actions in between or at the end. Users cannot edit the results, and two forms do not know each other, data cannot travel around, and so on.</p>

<p> On the contrary, cards are designed to be first-class citizens when comes to communication and sharing information. The following is true:
</p>

<p>Cards are individual apps.</p>
<p>Cards can blend and work together as one app.</p>
<p>Cards can share information between each other at run time for a single user or other users.</p>
<p>Cards have hierarchy, where one card may have more control over the other cards.</p>
<p>Cards can describe complex workflows</p>
<p>The data from using the apps constructed by cards can be view again, or view as report and send via email/SMS.</p>
<p>Cards come with custom made report system where reports are build in minutes and the output is in PDF or CSV</p>
