# Slider Element

Slider elements can be used for both **Forms** and **Cards**. The idea is to slide a scale with some units to indicate input. An example can be a scale that represents numbers from 1 to 100.

It comes with the following attributes


- **Question Text** - Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only. The text indicates to end-user what information they need to add an input.
- **Default Value** - By default this element comes as an optional. Information can be placed here at design time or at run time via the calculated field function (see below). A default value of 36.6 is assigned to help the user what this represents as a hint.
- **Optional** - Indicate if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.
- **Min Value** - Indicates what is the starting point for the slider to be represented visually to the user.
- **Max Value** - Indicates what is the ending point for the slider to be represented visually to the user.
- **Step Value** - Indicates when one unit is moved by the slider what that unit(step) is in value.
