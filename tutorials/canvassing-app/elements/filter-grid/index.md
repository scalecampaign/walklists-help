It comes with the following attributes


- **Question Text** - Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only. The text indicates to the end-user what action will follow if they press the button.
- **Optional** - Indicate if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.
- **Configure columns** - Provides the ability to preload the columns and supply the row cells. For example, let's add to the grid some popular Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu fighters. We will add Name, Country, Image, and Bio.
