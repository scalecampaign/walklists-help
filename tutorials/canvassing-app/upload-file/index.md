# Upload Data into WalkLists

The user can upload data inside walklists via two ways:
- One is via external drag and drop CSV formatted file  

[filename](walklists-upload-file.mp4 ':include :type=video')



- Second, If the user had already purshased internally via Walklsits data, that data maybe available for upload internally and use.
