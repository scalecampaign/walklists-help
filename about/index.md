# About WalkLists 

<p>Hi, my name is Ivan Assenov and I created <a href="https://walklists.com" target="_blank">WalkLists</a> to help those in need of political or consumer data or to organize walking campaigns via mobile, browser, or paper tools.</p>

<p>Many campaigns often do not have a good choice where to go for data or for canvassing apps, especially those that are not directly affiliated with the major political parties.</p>

<p>I created WalkLists to be a one-stop shop, independent and nonpartisan driven, by providing data integrity and security for any camping: small or large.</p>

<p>We are here to help you get things done.
Walk Lists give the users the ability to buy voter data in real-time and or bring their data and create canvassing campaigns with unlimited walk lists designed for mobile, Web, and paper.<p>

<p>It allows campaign managers, delegates, lobbyists, activists, and everyday people to organize an effort for a cause they believe in. 
The data comes from registered voter lists, donor lists, and commercial lists.<p>

<p>Users can purchase data easily with just a few clicks or by requesting details via email or phone. All 50 states are supported.  
Data comes with <a href="https://walklists.com/terms" target="_blank">WalkLists terms and conditions</a>
on use, so please read all license agreements before purchasing. </p>

</p>Our model gives a well-working campaign efficiency and robustness for the win. To grassroots campaigns, it gives the ability to step up the game.<p>

In the end, here is my advice to you: 
# Play the game to win it!
