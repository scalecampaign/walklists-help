# Add Single Map Pins to a cluster

**Remider - Users Can Create Unlimited Walk Lists**

WalkLists Layout Editing tools under Single map editing allows to group and combine map pins locations. 
The reason we may have orphan map pins outside of map clusters is because WalkLists uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help with the creating of the map clusters. Regardless how many algorithms we Use for AI, map routes are very complecated matter and not every route will be perfect. We try to give the user two choices:
- take advantage of AI and have first draft be done for our users by the system, where after that repairs are issued.
- start from scratch - after AI generates the cluster routes, simply remove all boundaries by clicking remove all button. start manually and design it according to personal preference. 
In this chapter, we will go in details how to adjunct orphan map pins to existing map clusters or group several orphan map pins into new cluster.
