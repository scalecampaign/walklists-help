I have the voter list from the secretary of state but I need it reduced it to walk list. I Am open to other services you may offer.
# Answer :

Thank you for your request. Usually the voter lists from secretary of states come in two parts: voter registration list and history list. 
When you prepare walk lists we recomend only the nessasery columns from one or both lists to be combined into one csv file. 
Please limit the number of columns to under 40, otherwise our observations are that this is becoming very clumzy for users and they have hard time focus on getting the right data populated. For more details, please see the video tutorial how to prepare voter file. 

As far to what other services we offer: we do carry some of the best voter and consumenr data and you you can sumbit a request for a quote. We also do custom software development.
