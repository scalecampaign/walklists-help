It comes with the following attributes


- **Question Text** - Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only. The text indicates to the end-user what action will follow if they press the button.
- **Optional** - Indicate if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.
- **Options** - By default the program will add one item with Option Text and option value. Users can add more after that. The **Option Text** is the text that will be displayed and **Option value** is the value the system will use for any internal communications. It is ok the pair to be the same or different.
