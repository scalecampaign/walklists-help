# Tutorial for Forms

What are **Forms** and how do they differ from **Cards**?

<p>Forms had been around for a long time either as part of the server-side/OS or by using Hypertext Markup Language on the client-side and then sending it to the server.

Users cannot edit the results, and two forms do not know each other, data cannot travel around, and so on. They are perfect for assessment, or one-way interaction with end-user. Shopping carts, inventory lists orders, etc...</p>
