It comes with the following attributes


- **Question Text** - Freestyle, multiline text. The text field is read-only. The text indicates to end-user what information they need to add an input.
- **Optional** - Indicate if this element is mandatory to be filled in at run time. By default, this is not selected and therefore the element is mandatory.
- **Placeholder** - This is used as a hint to specify an expected value in the input box. If clean, nothing will display. By default, a value of **Placeholder** is assigned.
- **Staff Signature** - Staff users can preload their signatures and have them already apprear on the app screen. To do that go to **Menu** -> **Settings** -> **Signature** -> sign your signature here. Click **Confirm** button.
