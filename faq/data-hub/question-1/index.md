 # Question1: What exactly is included in the "voter data" you're offering?
I understand the sorting and filtering by age, party affiliation, or 'special topics' etc. What I would like to know is do you offer the voter's full name, address and zip code along with this data?
# Answer:
Our data comes with very detailed section about the voter identity. We do carry their names, full addresses and zip codes. For more about the data itselves take a look at WalkLists Data Hub details.
