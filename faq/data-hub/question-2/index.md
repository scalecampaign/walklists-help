 # Do you include emails in your data?
I am looking to purchase voter data and I am interested if that comes with emails?
# Answer:
We need to understand better your wants and needs and based on that we would offer a package that will include emails. Because emails are changing constantly and they are very important for a campaign, we try to offer best quality of emails out there.
We offer typically two choices for emails:
- Unverified emails. These are emails that had come with the data but are not checked if they are real emails that are currently working. Typically the process is instant or may take day or two. 
- Verified emails. These are emails we put a lot of effort to make sure they get verified through rigorous process that uses top verification services and at the end the final product has an outstanding quality. It may take 4-5 business days for us to prepare verified batch of emails and not every row from the original file would have a match.
